# Titanic-Profile-Report-Pandas-Profiling-
This interactive HTML report, generated by YData-Profiling, offers a comprehensive, automated overview of dataset characteristics and quality. It streamlines initial data exploration, highlighting statistics, distributions, correlations, and potential issues for efficient data understanding and preparation in ML projects.

# Key Features of the Report:
The output.html report offers a detailed breakdown of the dataset, including:
Dataset Overview: Summarizes the total number of variables, observations, missing values, and duplicate rows.
Variable Statistics: For each column, it presents statistical summaries (mean, median, min, max, std dev), unique value counts, and missing value percentages.
Visual Distributions: Automatically generates histograms for numerical variables and bar charts for categorical variables, providing immediate visual insights into data distribution.
Interactions & Correlations: Displays various correlation matrices (e.g., Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, Phik) and interactive scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.
Missing Values Analysis: Offers visual representations of missing data patterns (matrix, bar chart, dendrogram) to help identify and strategize imputation methods.
Alerts & Warnings: Automatically flags potential data quality issues such as high cardinality, skewed distributions, highly correlated features, or columns with a high percentage of zeros/missing values.

#  Use Case
This report serves as a foundational deliverable for:
Initial Data Understanding: Quickly grasp the structure and content of a new dataset.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Identify missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies that require attention.
Feature Engineering: Discover potential relationships and distributions that can inform new feature creation.
Data Quality Assurance: Validate the integrity and quality of the ingested data.

# Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to generate the report.
Pandas: For data manipulation and integration with the profiling library.
YData-Profiling (formerly Pandas Profiling): The library used to create the interactive HTML report.
